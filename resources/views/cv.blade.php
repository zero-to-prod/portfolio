                                <p> One of the ways I <span class="font-bold">overcame</span> this challenge was to

                                    <span class="font-bold">affected</span> most. As I worked to solve the problem, I

                                    of the current state of things. My relationships with my colleagues became stronger
                                    as we worked <span class="font-bold">collaboratively</span>, which reinforced the

                                <p>Following my experience at RealClearPolitics, I arrived at ViewRail with valuable
                                    backend knowledge. I was well-acquainted with the project and its goal of
                                    transferring features from a legacy ColdFusion project to a contemporary tech
                                    stack.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Personal Development</h2>
                                <p> ViewRail's Technology stack impressed me with its advanced features, including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>GraphQL</li>
                                    <li>React</li>
                                    <li>TypeScript</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p> I was thrilled to have the opportunity to work with these new technologies, and I
                                    had the pleasure of being mentored by an exceptional individual who helped me expand
                                    my knowledge of web development.
                                </p>
                                <p>Thanks to this experience, I now understand the importance of type safety and how
                                    functional programming can effectively manage state.
                                </p>
